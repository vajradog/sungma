## The Problem

You're at a protest. You pull out your phone to document what's happening. Every face you capture becomes a target — for surveillance, for retaliation, for identification by systems you'll never know about.

Activists, journalists, and human rights workers face this every day. The tools that exist ask you to upload footage to a server, create an account, or trust a company with the most sensitive recordings you'll ever make.

**That's not protection. That's a liability.**

## What Sungma Does

Sungma is a camera that pixelates faces the moment they appear on screen. Not after you record. Not after you upload. *Before a single frame is ever saved.*

- **Faces are never captured in the clear.** The raw camera feed is processed in real time — what you see on screen is already protected.
- **Nothing leaves your device.** No servers. No cloud. No analytics. No network requests. The app works entirely offline.
- **No account. No sign-up. No permissions beyond your camera.** Open it and go.

It runs in your browser. There's nothing to install.

## How It Works (For You)

1. **Open Sungma** on your phone
2. **Point your camera** — faces are pixelated instantly
3. **Tap Photo** to capture a still, **Record** for video, or **Audio** for voice-only
4. **Save or share** directly from the preview

That's it. There is no step 5.

### Voice Distortion

Tap the microphone bar to cycle through distortion levels — subtle, medium, or heavy. Protects speaker identity in recordings without making audio unintelligible.

### Interview Mode

Need to document a conversation? Interview mode opens both cameras simultaneously — the back camera captures your subject (pixelated), while a small window shows you in the corner. One tap to start, one tap to stop.

### Evidence You Can Trust

Every photo Sungma takes embeds invisible proof data: a cryptographic hash of the image, GPS coordinates (if you allow it), and a timestamp. This metadata lives inside the image file itself — not on a server, not in a database. If someone questions whether a photo was altered, the proof travels with the file.

You can add a passphrase to encrypt this proof data, so only someone with the key can verify it.

## Why Sungma Exists

Because documentation shouldn't require sacrifice. Because the person holding the camera shouldn't have to choose between capturing evidence and protecting the people in the frame. Because privacy tools should be free, open, and accountable to no one except the people who use them.

Sungma is named after the Tibetan word for "guardian" — སྲུང་མ. It was built for the people who show up.
